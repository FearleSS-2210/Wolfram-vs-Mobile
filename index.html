        <h1>Wolfram vs MobileNet</h1>
        <p id="labelMAIN">We did a test and found out that which is more accurate, Wolfram or MobileNet</p>

        <div id="test1">
            <h3>Test 1 - Water Bottle</h3>
            <img id="img1" src="WaterBottle.png">
            <h4> Wolfram = Bottled Water ; MobileNet = Microphone</h4>
            <label id="output1">The output of Wolfram was wrong and the output of MobileNet was also wrong.</label>
        </div>


        <div id="test2">
            <h3>Test 2 - Ruler</h3>
            <img id="img2" src="Ruler.png">
            <h4> Wolfram = Rule ; MobileNet = Shovel </h4>
            <label id="output2">The output of Wolfram was wrong and the output of MobileNet was also wrong.</label>
        </div>


        <div id="test3">
            <h3>Test 3 - Pen</h3>
            <img id="img3" src="Pen.png">
            <h4> Wolfram = Refractometer ; MobileNet = File </h4>
            <label id="output3">The output of Wolfram was wrong and the output of MobileNet was aslo wrong.</label>
        </div>

        <h2>This shows that none of them are exactly accurate but Wolfram was more closer to the right answers than MobileNet.</h2>
